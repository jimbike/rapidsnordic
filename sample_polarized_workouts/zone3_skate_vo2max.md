## Skate VO2max Development

**Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Time:** 15:30 - 17:30  
**Location:** Mt. Itasca  
**Intensity:** 9/10 (Zone 3 - High Intensity)
**Target Races:** Proctor Invite, Cloquet, Mesabi East (Skate races)

### Purpose
Develop maximal oxygen uptake capacity and race-specific speed for 5K skate races. This session pushes physiological limits to create adaptation.

### Warm-Up (30 min)
- 15 min easy skate (Zone 1)
- 5 min dynamic stretching
  - Leg swings
  - Hip circles
  - Arm rotations
  - Torso twists
- 5 min progressive acceleration to VO2max pace
- 3 x 30 sec at target pace with 60 sec recovery
- 2 min easy ski

### Main Workout (60 min)

#### Set 1: VO2max Intervals (35 min)
**5 x 4 minutes at 90-95% max effort**
- **Pace:** 3-5K race pace
- **Recovery:** 3 minutes active (easy skiing)
- **Technique focus each interval:**
  1. V2 rhythm and timing
  2. Powerful leg drive
  3. Complete weight transfer
  4. Upper body contribution
  5. Maintain form when fatigued

**Execution notes:**
- Start strong but controlled
- Maintain even pace throughout interval
- HR should reach 90-95% max by minute 2
- If pace drops >10%, stop set

#### Recovery Transition (5 min)
- Very easy skiing
- Hydrate
- Mental reset

#### Set 2: Speed Endurance (20 min)
**8 x 1 minute HARD**
- **Pace:** Slightly faster than 5K pace
- **Recovery:** 90 seconds easy skiing
- **Focus:** Maintaining speed when fatigued

### Integrated Strength Circuit (15 min)
*Complete immediately after skiing*

**3 rounds, 45 sec rest between rounds:**
- 15 jump squats (explosive)
- 20 skater hops (lateral power)
- 15 box jumps or step-ups
- 20 V-ups (core)
- 10 burpees (full body)

### Cool Down (15 min)
- 10 min very easy ski (Zone 1)
- 5 min walking and static stretching

### Skate-Specific Technical Points

#### V2 Technique Keys:
- Initiate with core rotation
- Drive through heels
- Complete weight transfer
- Synchronize poling with leg push
- Maintain forward body position

#### Common Errors to Avoid:
- Incomplete weight transfer
- Late poling timing
- Collapsing core when tired
- Shortened glide phase
- Dropping hips

### Race Application

**How This Translates to Skate Races:**
- Intervals match race duration segments
- Builds ability to sustain race pace
- Develops finishing speed
- Improves lactate buffering
- Enhances mental toughness

### Pacing Guidelines
- First interval: Control the effort (90%)
- Middle intervals: Hit target pace (95%)
- Last interval: Maximum effort possible
- Better to maintain quality than add volume

### Monitoring & Adjustment

**Good Session Indicators:**
✅ Maintained pace across intervals  
✅ HR reached 90-95% max  
✅ Could complete all intervals  
✅ Technique stayed solid  

**Warning Signs (Stop/Reduce):**
⚠️ Pace drops >15% from target  
⚠️ Unable to reach target HR  
⚠️ Technique completely breaks down  
⚠️ Unusual pain or discomfort  

### Recovery Protocol
- Protein + carbs within 30 min
- Foam roll tonight
- Easy day tomorrow (Zone 1 only)
- 8+ hours sleep mandatory
- Monitor morning HR (should return to baseline in 48hr)

### Mental Training Component
During intervals, practice:
- Breaking effort into segments
- Positive self-talk phrases
- Focusing on technique when tired
- Embracing the discomfort
- Race simulation mindset

### Equipment
- Skate race skis
- Heart rate monitor (essential)
- Extra water/sports drink
- Warm layers for recovery

### Coach Notes
- This is a breakthrough workout
- Quality over quantity always
- Stop if form degrades significantly
- Follow with 2 easy days minimum
