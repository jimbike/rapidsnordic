- Close eyes during static holds when safe

#### Strength Integration:
- Keep movements controlled and precise
- Focus on ski-specific patterns
- Maintain Zone 1 heart rate throughout
- Quality movement over heavy resistance

#### Technique Focus:
- This is skill development, not fitness
- Perfect practice makes perfect
- Film yourself if possible for review
