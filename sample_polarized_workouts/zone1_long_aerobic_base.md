## Long Aerobic Base Building

**Date:** December 14, 2025 (Saturday)  
**Time:** 09:00 - 11:30  
**Location:** Mt. Itasca Trails  
**Intensity:** 3-4/10 (Zone 1 - Easy Aerobic)
**Heart Rate Target:** 60-70% max HR

### Purpose
Build aerobic capacity and muscular endurance. This session develops the aerobic engine that powers all other training. Time on skis at easy pace is the foundation of endurance sports success.

### Workout Structure

### Warm-Up (15 min)
- 10 min very easy skiing
- 5 min dynamic movements and technique drills

### Main Workout (2 hours)
#### Continuous Aerobic Skiing
- 2 hours of steady, easy-pace skiing
- Mix terrain: flats, gentle hills, varied snow conditions
- Switch between Classic and Skate if desired (or focus on one)

#### Pace Guidelines:
- Should be able to maintain full conversation
- Heart rate stays steady (no spikes)
- Feeling like you could go "all day"
- Nose breathing should be possible most of the time

#### Mental Focus Points (Rotate every 20 min):
1. Perfect weight transfer
2. Maximize glide phase
3. Relaxed upper body
4. Efficient poling
5. Smooth transitions
6. Rhythm and flow

### Cool Down (15 min)
- 10 min very easy ski
- 5 min walking and light stretching

### Fueling Strategy
- Bring water and sports drink
- Small snack at 1 hour mark (banana, energy bar)
- Focus on consistent hydration

### Important Guidelines
- **Do NOT race**: If passed by another skier, let them go
- **Stay aerobic**: If breathing hard, slow down
- **Enjoy the process**: This should feel enjoyable, not grueling
- **Build gradually**: If 2 hours feels too long, start with 90 min

### Adaptation Benefits
- Increased mitochondrial density
- Improved fat oxidation
- Enhanced capillarization
- Better skiing economy
- Mental toughness through duration

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Starting too fast
- Turning it into a race
- Not eating/drinking enough
- Ignoring technique when tired
- Comparing pace to others

### Post-Workout
- Eat within 30 minutes
- Gentle stretching or yoga
- Rest or very easy activity remainder of day

### Equipment Needed
- Comfortable skis (not necessarily race skis)
- Hydration belt or plan for water stops
- Snacks
- Extra layers for weather changes
