## Active Recovery Session

**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Time:** 15:30 - 16:30 (only 1 hour!)  
**Location:** Grand Rapids HS or Mt. Itasca  
**Intensity:** 3/10 (Zone 1 - Recovery)
**Heart Rate Target:** <65% max HR

### Purpose
Promote recovery from yesterday's high-intensity session. This workout enhances blood flow, reduces muscle soreness, and prepares the body for upcoming training while allowing adaptation to occur.

### Workout Structure

### Warm-Up (10 min)
- 5 min very easy movement (walking or skiing)
- 5 min gentle dynamic stretching

### Main Workout (35 min)
#### Option A: Easy Ski
- 35 min continuous easy skiing
- Flat terrain preferred
- Focus on relaxation and smooth movement
- Stop if you feel any urge to go harder

#### Option B: Cross-Training
- 20 min easy ski or walk
- 15 min core and flexibility work:
  - Planks: 3 x 30 seconds
  - Bird dogs: 2 x 10 each side
  - Yoga flow or stretching routine

### Cool Down (15 min)
- 5 min very easy movement
- 10 min comprehensive stretching
  - Hold each stretch 30+ seconds
  - Focus on hips, hamstrings, calves, back

### Recovery Guidelines
- **Truly easy**: If you question whether it's too hard, slow down
- **Short duration**: More is not better on recovery days
- **Listen to your body**: Skip if feeling overly fatigued
- **Breathe deeply**: Use nasal breathing to ensure easy pace

### Mental Approach
- This is NOT a training session
- Think "movement meditation"
- Focus on enjoying the movement
- Practice gratitude for your body's capabilities

### Alternative Recovery Options
If weather is poor or you're very tired:
- 30 min easy walk
- 45 min yoga session
- 30 min easy bike ride
- Swimming (very easy pace)

### Signs You're Going Too Hard
- Breathing through mouth consistently
- Heart rate climbing above 65% max
- Feeling like you're "getting a workout"
- Legs feeling heavy or worked

### Recovery Enhancers
- Hydrate throughout the day
- Eat quality nutrition
- Get 8+ hours sleep tonight
- Consider foam rolling later
- Take a warm (not hot) bath

### Notes
- Recovery days are where fitness is built
- Going harder does NOT equal better results
- Trust the process - easy days enable hard days
- Champions respect recovery

### Equipment Needed
- Most comfortable skis
- Heart rate monitor (to ensure staying easy)
- Water bottle
