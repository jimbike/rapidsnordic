## Threshold Tempo Session

**Date:** December 25, 2025  
**Time:** 15:30 - 17:00  
**Location:** Mt. Itasca  
**Intensity:** 7/10 (Zone 2 - Threshold)
**Heart Rate Target:** 75-85% max HR

### Purpose
Develop lactate threshold and race pace sustainability. This session should be used sparingly (1-2 times per month) as it's the most fatiguing relative to fitness gains.

### Important Note
**Zone 2 sessions should comprise <10% of total training volume in polarized model**

### Warm-Up (20 min)
- 10 min easy ski (Zone 1)
- 5 min progressive build to tempo pace
- 3 x 1 min at tempo pace with 1 min recovery
- 2 min easy ski

### Main Workout (40 min)
#### Threshold Tempo
- 2 x 15 minutes at threshold pace
- 5 minutes easy recovery between sets
- Pace: "Comfortably hard" - sustainable but challenging

#### Pace Guidelines:
- Breathing is rhythmic but labored
- Can speak 3-4 words at a time
- Feels like 10K race pace
- Sustainable for 45-60 minutes if fresh

### Cool Down (20-30 min)
- 15 min easy ski (Zone 1)
- 5 min walk
- 10 min stretching

### Execution Points
- **Steady effort**: Avoid surges - maintain even pace
- **Stay in zone**: Don't drift into Zone 3
- **Monitor closely**: Use HR or pace to stay on target
- **Quality technique**: Maintain form throughout

### When to Use This Workout
- Mid-season race pace preparation
- 2-3 weeks before important races
- Not more than once per 10-14 days
- Never back-to-back with Zone 3 days

### Warning About Zone 2
- Most fatiguing zone relative to adaptation
- Easy to overtrain in this zone
- Creates fatigue that impacts Zone 3 quality
- Use sparingly and purposefully

### Recovery Requirements
- Follow with easy day
- Monitor fatigue levels closely
- Ensure quality sleep
- May need 48 hours before next quality session

### Notes
- This is the "gray zone" - use judiciously
- If you must choose, prioritize Zone 3 over Zone 2
- Better to be 5% undertrained than 1% overtrained

### Equipment Needed
- Race or performance skis
- Heart rate monitor crucial for staying in zone
- Water and electrolytes

*Zone 2 Training: Use sparingly, like salt in cooking - a little enhances, too much ruins.*
