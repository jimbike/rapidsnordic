## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Zone-Based Training Structure
Every workout now includes:
- **Zone designation** (1, 2, or 3)
- **Intensity rating** (3-10 scale)
- **Heart rate targets** for each zone
- **Specific focus** for the session

### 2. Weekly Distribution Pattern
Workouts now follow the polarized model:
- **~80% Zone 1** (Easy/Aerobic) - Intensity 3-5
- **~5% Zone 2** (Threshold) - Intensity 6-7 (minimal use)
- **~15% Zone 3** (High Intensity) - Intensity 8-10

### 3. Integrated Components

#### Balance Training (Every Session)
- 10 minute pre-practice balance activation
- Balance challenges integrated into main workout
- Daily homework assignments

#### Strength Training
- **Zone 1 days**: 15-20 min bodyweight circuits post-workout
- **Zone 3 days**: Power-focused exercises integrated
- Always maintains appropriate zone heart rate

#### Race-Specific Preparation
- Zone 3 workouts aligned with upcoming race demands
- Pre-race activation protocols
- Race simulation sessions

## Important Notes for Coaches

### Zone Discipline is Critical
- **Zone 1 MUST be easy** - Athletes should finish refreshed
- **Zone 3 MUST be hard** - Maximum effort required
- **Minimize Zone 2** - Only for specific race pace work

### Recovery Between Zone 3 Sessions
- Minimum 48 hours between high-intensity sessions
- Always follow Zone 3 with Zone 1 day
- Monitor athlete fatigue closely

### Balance & Strength Integration
- Never sacrifice ski time for gym time
- Keep strength circuits short (15-20 min)
- Daily balance work is non-negotiable
- Focus on ski-specific movements

### Pre-Race Protocols
- Reduce volume by 40-50% in race week
- Maintain intensity with short bursts
- No new elements in final 3 days
- Trust the taper

## Monitoring Success

### Athletes Should Feel:
✅ Fresh for Zone 3 sessions  
✅ Able to complete all intervals  
✅ Technically improving on easy days  
✅ Excited for races  
✅ Recovering well between sessions  

### Warning Signs:
⚠️ Consistently tired  
⚠️ Unable to hit Zone 3 targets  
⚠️ Poor sleep quality  
⚠️ Declining performance  
⚠️ Lack of motivation

## Next Steps

1. **Educate Athletes** on zone training and why "easy" is beneficial
2. **Consider HR Monitors** for accurate zone training
3. **Track Weekly Distribution** to ensure proper zone balance
4. **Adjust Individual Needs** based on athlete response
5. **Measure Results** through time trials and race performance
